<p>Using bayesian statistics to find out the relative performance of meat-based organisms against robots</p>

<p>Hey there! In this article we will go through a little experiment that has been done recently (August 2020).</p>

<p>The question we address is the good-old all-terrain:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“How is the classification-accuracy of humans compared to the one of AI-based methods?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is concise and vague; a useless line in this article if we don’t go into the specifics. That is the purpose of the following two sections.</p>

<p>but before we start:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GastonMazzei/music-ai-experiment"><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Full code is public</a>. That means you can 1.generate a quiz for humans to answer, 2.collect the results and 3.process them against an AI-based classifier <strong>in only one click</strong>. Ok, actually in like five clicks…</p>

<p>Let’s cut to the chase, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="1-building-an-experiment-for-humans-a-quiz">1. Building an experiment for humans: a quiz</h2>

<p><em>**Quick Question: **Can you identify the composer from this sample? options below</em></p>

<p>In order to find out how good humans actually are at recognizing authors from short (7 seconds) music samples, a quiz was made. Average-opinion got to be that it isn’t easy!</p>

<p>The main thing to point out is that **the quiz was a <a href="http://shorturl.at/irzIS">randomly-changing Google Form,</a> **i.e. a Google Form in which sound-samples vary with time.</p>

<p>Randomly changing questions allowed us to gather answers for +120 samples while <strong>individual visitors answered only 6</strong>.</p>

<p>This and the fact that <strong>sound samples last 7 seconds **are</strong> <strong>ways to make it more appealing **in the context of dealing with a short attention span</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Randomly-changing Google-Form-Quizzes can be made using the public <a href="https://github.com/GastonMazzei/music-ai-experiment">code of the experiment</a>, or using <a href="https://github.com/GastonMazzei/random-google-form">this</a> brief specific repository. <strong>The form is wired to a spreadsheet so it ultimately comes down to waiting for people to answer and downloading a .csv!</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JOVwSh6GSXB4COM1ZyaRAElkiiyusb5v2IWcfWVD1sw/edit?usp=sharing">Quiz-results are also public</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In an attempt to keep the article short, let us briefly define:</em>
<strong>A feed-forward multi-class neural network is a probability distribution composed with a smooth nonlinear mapping</strong>. <em>(1)</em> At first the smooth mapping transforms our data, and <em>(2)</em> at last classification is done using a probability distribution *(image below; parameters are obtained via minimization with gradient descent). <strong>*On the other hand, random forest classifiers are an ensemble of decision trees.</strong>
The training was done using ~50 songs per composer: by splitting midi works into 7-second-fragments a training set of ~20k points was built. Each point had 500 features representing 7 seconds of music; features included: pitch, duration &amp; volume.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI-based classification-models consistently beat humans for every composer</strong> <em>(except for Stravinsky, for whom not enough training-data was available)</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Humans outperformed the random hypothesis</strong> for over half of the composers. At best, for Vivaldi, they doubled it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The</strong> (perhaps not so fashion?) <strong>random-forest classifier outperformed systematically the neural network</strong>. This is no coincidence: with ~20k datapoints and ~500 features the classification problem is arguably better suited for the former given that the ‘data/degrees of freedom’ ratio allows for more inner-complexity.</p>
